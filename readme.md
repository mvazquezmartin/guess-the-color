![Guess The Color Responsives](/assets/Screenshot.png "Guess The Color")

This is a simple web application where users can guess an RGB color value by adjusting the red, green, and blue components using sliders. The user's guess is compared to a randomly generated color, and feedback is provided on how close the guess is to the correct color.


## Features

- Adjustable sliders for red, green, and blue color components.
- Buttons to increment or decrement each color component individually.
- Feedback on the closeness of the user's guess to the correct color.
- Visual representation of the user's remaining attempts.


## Usage

1. **Adjust Color Components:** Use the sliders or increment/decrement buttons to adjust the red, green, and blue color components individually.

2. **Guess the Color:** Once you are satisfied with your color guess, click the "GUESS" button to see how close your guess is to the correct color.

3. **Feedback:** After guessing, you will receive feedback on how close your guess is to the correct color. The feedback will indicate the percentage of closeness to the correct color and update the visual representation of remaining attempts.

4. **Reset:** Click the "RESET" button at any time to start a new game. This will reset the color components, attempts, and provide a new randomly generated color for guessing.
